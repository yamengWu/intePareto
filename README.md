# intePareto
**intePareto** is designed to prioritize genes with consistent changes in RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data of different histone modifications betweeen different conditions using Pareto optimization.

The intePareto workflow starts with RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data for two different celltypes or conditions. The ChIP-Seq data will in general comprise information on several histone modifications with activating or repressing function. The end product of intePareto is a list of genes prioritized accordingto congruence of changes of gene expression and histone modifications.

The detailed examples of using **intePareto** is shown in this [case study example] (https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12864-020-07205-6/MediaObjects/12864_2020_7205_MOESM1_ESM.pdf).
